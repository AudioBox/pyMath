# pyMath

Simple programs written in Python language for the purpose of learning basic syntax & visualizing concepts in mathematics.

Topics to include:

  * Combinatorics
  * Calculus
  * Graph Theory
  * Statistics
  * Optimization

This is, by no means, a hub for mathematically factual information. Instead, it is a sandbox to test and learn.
